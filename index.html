<h1>About Myself</h1>
<body>
    <p>
        My name is Gina Ekwealor
    with student id ALT/SOE/023/2301. 
    I generally hate to talk about myself so this homework is difficult. I will rather you ask me what you want to know and i will answer you or plead the fifth.
    </p>
    <h2> Why Alt school?</h2>
    I choose alt school because a friend recommened it to me. So far so good i am liking it. Really hope all the teachers in semesters to come will be as good as Setemi. keeping an open mind.
    <h3>What do you want to achieve from Alt school?</h3>
    I sincerely hope i can learn all i need to know so i can be a great software engineer. Trying to make myself proud.
